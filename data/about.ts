Hi 👋, I'm Sai Vara Prasad — an adaptive developer from Hyderabad, India, passionate about building tech that makes life better.

I hold a B.E. in CS (AI & ML) from Keshav Memorial Engineering College, affiliated with Osmania University. I've worked as a Frontend Developer at StartDate Technologies and interned at LoomyLabs (now LoomyGO).

A passion for tech took me from mobile development to ML & AI. I found my niche in web development, constantly learning and building solutions in the ever-evolving digital landscape.

From 'enabling crowds to shape music' to 'transforming waste into opportunity' — I love creating solutions that make a real-world difference.
